# Zillow-Data-ETL
This repository contains code for an end-to-end ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow using Python bash scripts in order to migrate data to the AWS cloud. Uses Zillow RapidAPI to extract real estate property data from Fishkill, New York, transform the data into a csv file using Amazon lambda functions, and then load the clean data into an Amazon s3 bucket. The pipeline then transfers clean data into an Amazon Redshift cluster and connects the cluster to Amazon QuickSight to visualize different data models and perform analytics.
